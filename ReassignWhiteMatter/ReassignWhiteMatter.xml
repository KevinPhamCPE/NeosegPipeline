   <title>Reassign White Matter</title>
   <description>A tool to reassign small islands of white matters according to the probability maps. For any suggestion or question,  please contact styner[at]unc.edu, jprieto[at]med.unc.edu. The xml parameter file needs to contain the following information: \n REASSIGN-WHITE-MATTER-PARAMETERS is the main parameter tag \n INPUT = input label file \n THRESHOLD = minimal size of component that is not reassigned \n Also provide filenames for a series of posterior probability maps via the PROBABILITY-MAP tags, one per probability map: Assumption is that order of the probability map filenames is the same as the labels in the labelmap \n OUTPUT = reassigned label file \n \n VOXEL-BY-VOXEL = compute reassigned voxel-by-voxel \n LABEL-VALUE = which label to replace (if component is smaller than threshold)
